# Memory Game

My submission of [TOP's Memory Game Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-memory-card).

Made with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [React](https://react.dev/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## How To Play
- The game consists of a grid of flags. The order of flags is important here and the players have to make a mental note of the order in which the flags appear.

- As soon as the player clicks on the first flag the game starts and the player would be presented with shuffled order of flags on each subsequent click.

- The players have to click the flags in the same order as the one presented to them at the start of the game.

- Player wins if they are able to replicate the order of flags they start with.

## Variations
